# Fashion MNIST Predictor

The goal is to build a Neural Network which is able to predict the following labels using python.
   0 T-shirt/top
   1 Trouser
   2 Pullover  
   3 Dress 
   4 Coat 
   5 Sandal 
   6 Shirt 
   7 Sneaker
   8 Bag 
   9 Ankle boot
 
This is done using the following libraries-
    Keras ( tensorflow in backend ).
    Matplotlib ( for plotting and analysing the data ). 
    Numpy ( for mathematical calculations and  normalising data ).
    Warnings ( I have used filterwarnings to ignore warnings and make code readable ).
    
The data has been taken from Keras MNIST dataset.
