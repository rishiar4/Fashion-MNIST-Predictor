# Fashion MNIST Predictor

The goal is to build a Neural Network which is able to predict the following labels using python.

 This is done using the following libraries-
    Keras ( tensorflow in backend ).
    Matplotlib ( for plotting and analysing the data ). 
    Numpy ( for mathematical calculations and  normalising data ).
    Warnings ( I have used filterwarnings to ignore warnings and make code readable ).
    
 The data has been taken from Keras MNIST dataset.
 Explanation:
   1. Loading the Libraries.
   2. Loading the data and spliting it into Train and Test Data.

   3. Analysing the data.

   4. Normalising the data.

   5. Importing the Sequential Models and using the Sequentail layers.
   6. Compiling the Model and Evaluating the data.
   7. Using Plotly library to Evaluate the Prediction.
   
   8. The accuracy score of the model is 85%.
